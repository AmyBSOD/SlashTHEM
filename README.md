Slash'EM Extended Mod
=====================

Slash'EM Extended Mod is a fork of Slash'EM Extended version 75.  It's primary goals are to add more flavor to the game, create unique quests for most of the new roles, and apply some much needed balance changes.  Overall, the difficulty will be a bit higher than Slash'EM, but nowhere near the difficulty of Slash'EM Extended.

This should compile fine on Windows (with MinGW) and Unix systems.  I haven't done any testing on other platforms.

Current Status
--------------

Should be playable.  Most of the new roles that I haven't touched will probably have a hard time with quests, as for the most part they don't have specific monster types to show up and instead chooses from random species and such.  For the most part, this is still a work in progress.

Todo
----

Fix new and old bugs.

Clean up compiler warnings.

Finish giving every role a sacrifice gift.

Overhaul a few of the lazily done quests.

More balance changes. (Role/Race stats, weapon damage.)

A massive cleanup of monsters, objects and roles.

Update the Guidebook.

Plenty of stuff not yet listed here.

Bugs
----
Monsters using a wand of banishment tends to cause a segfault.  Will probably disable/remove.

Traps are sometimes generated outside of defined levels (still?)

Some roles aren't possible to choose on a a 80x24 terminal due to sharing the same character (eg: Lunatic/Locksmith)

Probably a ton of others.
