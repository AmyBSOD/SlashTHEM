Slash'EM Extended Mod
Based on Slash'EM Extended (http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Slash%27EM_Extended)

Originally a minor modification to allow ghoul player characters to eat
human corpses without penalty, this grew over time and added artifacts,
among other things.  A few friends became interested and I felt like I
should upload the code somewhere for public viewing and usage.

Currently this is a mostly vanilla build of Slash'EM Extended, with unix
support added.  I am in the process of re-doing my changes in order to 
have my changes tracked by git.  This should take less than a week, after
which I'll continue adding various changes as I see fit.
