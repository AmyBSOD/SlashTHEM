Slash'EM Extended Mod
Based on Slash'EM Extended (http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Slash%27EM_Extended)

Originally a minor modification to allow ghoul player characters to eat
human corpses without penalty, this grew over time and added artifacts,
among other things.  A few friends became interested and I felt like I
should upload the code somewhere for public viewing and usage.

Currently this is a mostly vanilla build of Slash'EM Extended, with unix
support added.  I am in the process of re-doing my changes in order to 
have my changes tracked by git.  This should take less than a week, after
which I'll continue adding various changes as I see fit.

Bugs are to be expected, either from upstream or from my own mistakes.

Credits to Percival Tiglao for minor sling upgrade patch and Mikael Lind 
for both the Rubber Gloves and Gauntlets of Reflection.  All patches are 
available on Bilious.alt.org.

Credits to Chris on #nethack for creating dNethack, of which I've used a 
few things from.

Credits to BarclayII on Github for Slashem-up for some of the changes applied
 to this variant, in particular the acid damage for artifacts.

And credits to anyone I may be missing, I'll add more as I go along.
